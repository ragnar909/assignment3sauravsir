<h3>2. What kind of statements can be written outside the function body?</h3>

<h3>4. What is the value of an uninitialised variable?</h3>
<h4>answer: the value of uninitialised variable is unpredictible.</h4>
<h3>5. What is the difference between float and double?</h3>
<h4>answer: float has 4 bytes whereas double has 8 bytes;
    float follows single precision whereas double follows double precision.
</h4>
<h3>6. What is the full form of ASCII?</h3>
